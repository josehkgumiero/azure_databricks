# DevOps, CI/CD, and task orchestration
- The development lifecycles for ETL pipelines, ML models, and analytics dashboards each present their own unique challenges. Azure Databricks allows all of your users to leverage a single data source, which reduces duplicate efforts and out-of-sync reporting. By additionally providing a suite of common tools for versioning, automating, scheduling, deploying code and production resources, you can simplify your overhead for monitoring, orchestration, and operations. Workflows schedule Azure Databricks notebooks, SQL queries, and other arbitrary code. Repos let you sync Azure Databricks projects with a number of popular git providers.
