# WHat is databricks data science & engineering?
- Databricks data science & engineering (sometimes called simply "workspace") is an analysis platform based on apache spark. It is integrated with azure to provide one-click setup, streamlined workflows and an interactive workspace that enables collaboration between data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers.
- For a big data pipeline, the data (raw or structured) is ingested into azure through azure data factory in batches, or streamed near real-time using apache kafka event hubs, or iot hub. This data lands in a data lake for long term persisted storage, in azure blob storage or azure data lake storage. As part of your analytics workflow, use azure data bricks to read data from multple data sources such as azure blob storage, azur data lake storage, azure cosmos db, or azure sql data warehouse and turn it into breakthrough insights using spark.
