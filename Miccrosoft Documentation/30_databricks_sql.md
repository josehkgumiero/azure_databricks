Regularly used SQL code can be saved as snippets for quick reuse, and query results can be cached to keep run times short. Additionally, query updates can be scheduled to automatically refresh, as well as to issue alerts when meaningful changes occur in the data. Databricks SQL also allows analysts to make sense of data through visualizations and drag-and-drop dashboards for quick ad-hoc exploratory analysis.
