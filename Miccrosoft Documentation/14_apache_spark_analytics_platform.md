# Apache Spark analytics platform
- Databricks data science & engineering comprises the complete open-source apache spark cluster technologies and capabilities. Spark in databricks data science & engineering includes the following components:
    - spark sql and dataframes: spark sql is the spark module for working with strucutred data. A DataFrame is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or  a data frame in r/python.
    - Streaming: real-time data processing and analysis for analytical and interactive applications. Integrates with HDFS, Flume, and Kafka.
    - MLlib: machine learning ibrary conssiting of common learnning algorithms and utilities including classification, regressio, clustering, collaborative filtering, dimensionallity reduction, as well as underlying optimization primitives.
    - GraphX: graphs and graph computation for a broad scope of use cases fro cognitive anlytics to data exploration.
    - Spark core api: includes support for, sl, python, scala, and java.
