# How does Azure Databricks work with Azure?
- The Azure Databricks platform architecture is composed of two primary parts: the infrastructure used by Azure Databricks to deploy, configure, and manage the platform and services, and the customer-owned infrastructure managed in collaboration by Azure Databricks and your company.
- UNlike many enterprise database companies, Azure Databricks does not force you to migrate your data into proprietary storage systems in order to use the platform. Insteadm your configure a Azure Databricks workspace by configuring secure integrations between the Azure Databricks platform and your cloud account to process and store data in object storage and other integrated services control.
- Unity Catlog furter extends this relatioship, allowing you to manage permissions for accessng data using familiar SQL sntax from within Azure Databricks.
- Azure Databricks has deployed workspaces that meet the security and neetworking requirenments of some of the world' largest and most security-minded companies. Azure Databricks makes it easy for new users to get started on the platform and removes many of the burdens and concerns of woring with cloud infrastructure from end users, but does not limit the customizations and control experienced data, operations, and security teams require.
