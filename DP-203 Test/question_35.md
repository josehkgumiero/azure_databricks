Identify the missing word(s) in the following sentence within the context of Microsoft Azure.

When working with large data sets, it can take a long time to run the sort of queries that clients need. These queries can't be performed in real time, and often require algorithms such as MapReduce that operate in parallel across the entire data set. The results are then stored separately from the raw data and used for querying.

One drawback to this approach is that it introduces latency. If processing takes a few hours, a query may return results that are several hours old. Ideally, you would like to get some results in real time (perhaps with some loss of accuracy), and combine these results with the results from the batch analytics.

The Lambda architecture is a big data processing architecture that addresses this problem by combining both batch- and real-time processing methods. It features an append-only immutable data source that serves as system of record. Timestamped events are appended to existing events (nothing is overwritten). Data is implicitly ordered by time of arrival.

The [?] is a vast improvement upon the traditional Lambda architecture. At each stage, we enrich our data through a unified pipeline that allows us to combine batch and streaming workflows through a shared filestore with ACID-compliant transactions.
