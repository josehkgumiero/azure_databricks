Identify the missing word(s) in the following sentence within the context of Microsoft Azure.

Azure Databricks (ADB) is a Big Data analytics service. Being a Cloud Optimized managed PaaS offering, it is designed to hide the underlying distributed systems and networking complexity as much as possible from the end user.

Multiple clusters can exist within a workspace, and there's a one-to-many mapping between a Subscription to Workspaces, and further, from one Workspace to multiple Clusters.

Azure Databricks is a multitenant service and to provide fair resource sharing to all regional customers, it imposes limits on API calls. These limits are expressed at the Workspace level and are due to internal ADB components.

Key workspace limits are:

• The maximum number of jobs that a workspace can create in an hour is [A]

• At any time, you cannot have more than [B] jobs simultaneously running in a workspace

• There can be a maximum of [C] notebooks or execution contexts attached to a cluster

• There can be a maximum of [D] Azure Databricks API calls/hour
